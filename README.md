# Stock Market Real-Time Data Engineering Project Using Kafka  

## 📌 Overview  
In this project, I have built a complete **end-to-end data engineering pipeline** for real-time stock market data using **Apache Kafka**.  

The project integrates various **technologies** such as **Python, AWS (Amazon Web Services), Apache Kafka, Glue, Athena, and SQL** to process and analyze stock market data in real time.

## 📂 Architecture  
The architecture involves:  
✅ **Kafka** for real-time data streaming  
✅ **AWS S3** for data storage  
✅ **Glue Crawlers & Glue Catalog** for schema discovery and data cataloging  
✅ **Athena** for running SQL queries on S3 data

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Cloud Platform:** AWS (Amazon Web Services)  
- **AWS Services Used:**  
  - **S3 (Simple Storage Service)** – Stores raw and processed data  
  - **Athena** – Executes SQL queries on S3 data  
  - **Glue Crawler & Glue Catalog** – Automates schema discovery  
  - **EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)** – Hosts Kafka brokers  
  - **Apache Kafka** – Enables real-time data streaming

## 📊 Dataset  
This project is designed to work with **any stock market dataset** since the main goal is to **build a scalable real-time data pipeline**.  

For reference, I used the following dataset:
