# stock-market-kafka-project

Overview
In this project, I have built a complete end-to-end data engineering pipeline for real-time stock market data using Apache Kafka.

The project integrates various technologies such as Python, AWS (Amazon Web Services), Apache Kafka, Glue, Athena, and SQL to process and analyze stock market data in real time.

Architecture
The architecture involves setting up Kafka for real-time data streaming, AWS S3 for storage, Glue Crawlers & Catalog for data organization, and Athena for querying the data efficiently.

Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Cloud Platform: AWS (Amazon Web Services)
Services Used:
S3 (Simple Storage Service) â€“ For storing raw and processed data
Athena â€“ For running SQL queries on S3 data
Glue Crawler & Glue Catalog â€“ For schema discovery and data cataloging
EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) â€“ For deploying Kafka brokers
Apache Kafka â€“ For real-time data streaming
Dataset
I have designed this project to work with any stock market dataset, as the focus is on building a scalable real-time data pipeline rather than analyzing a specific dataset.

For reference, I used the following dataset:
